# MergeSort
Let your own computer teach you recursion via one of the most famous
algorithms, Merge Sort!!
## What is this program?!
This program is a command-line teacher who can teach you step by step what's
happening in the Merge Sort algorithm. You give it a list of numbers, seperated
by spaces(!), and this guy sorts it not in a quick computer mode, but in a mode
so that all of us can understand what the heck is happening on each step!  
But also note that this is one of those talkative teachers(and you are always
welcome to change the source code to make it less or more talkative, or
whatever...!) but I don't recommend giving it long lists of numbers...
(believe me, it would be boring!)...
## How to use it?!
It's super easy! Just go ahead and open a terminal and type these three
commands:  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DrNakiz/MergeSort.git
$ cd MergeSort
$ python3 CLI.py
```
Then you give your teacher some numbers, seperated by spaces...  
And you'll get to watch as master computer sorts the numbers and explains each
step(almost!)...  
**Note**: This README will be completed with much more explanations...
